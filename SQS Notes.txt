SQS Basics:
1. SQS is first AWS created.
2. SQS is used for queuing messages.
3. e.g.User uploads image ---> SQS got new message ---> SQS sends to application server that message to perform an action.
4. Messages can be 256 KB of text in any format.
5. SQS does not guarantee the ordering of messages. If an application wants ordering then they have to add ordering mechanism 
to each message.
6. SQS is pull based rather than push.
7. Message gets deleted from the queue only when its processed.
8. Visibility timeout is the time frame given to a message when a component is processing message. During this time the
message is not available to other components for processing. This prevents duplicate processing of message.
9. Auto scaling is possible when a queue is growing to big to allow more processing units. All big websites use this.
10. default visibility timeout 30 secs and max of 12 hours visibility timeout using changeMessageVisibility. At 
least once delivery.
11. you are billed every 64 kb chunks as a unit. if 256 = 4(64 kb each) requests billed.
12. Long polling - if no messages in queue wait (20 secs default)
13. Short polling - Polling after fixed interval.

Some ARN formats :
arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource
arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resourcetype/resource
arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resourcetype:resource

Examples :
<!-- IAM user name -->
arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/David

<!-- Amazon RDS instance used for tagging -->

S3 Basics:
1. S3 is Object based storage rather than block based storage.
2. File size min 0 bytes to 5 TBs.
3. Unlimited storage.
4. Files are stored in a bucket.
5. S3 names should be unique globally.
6. S3 bucket link : https://S3-<region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket name>
example : https://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mybucket.
7. S3 is key value based storage. every object has a key a value a version and metadata(date/time etc).
8. S3 stores objects in alphabetical fashion.
9. S3 also has ACL and torrent features.
10. S3 guarantees for 99.9% availability and 99.9999999999% durability.
11. S3 is designed for 99.99% availability.
12. Tiered storage, Lifecycle management, Versioning, encryption, ACL and bucket policies.


S3 Data consistency:
1. Read over write for PUTS of new objects.
2. Eventual consistency for modify or delete. ie you might get new data or you might get old data.
3. All operations are atomic so you wont get mixed data of 2 commits.

S3 Storage Tiers:
1. S3 99.99% availability and 11x9 durability. Designed to sustained a loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
 data is stored at multiple facilities.
2. S3 - IA Infrequently accessed. 99.9% availability.
3. RRS- Reduced redundancy storage with 99.99% durability. Thumbnails example. Can sustain loss of 1 facility.
4. Glacier - Used for archival only. Accessing can take 3 to 5 hours.

S3 Pricing: 
1. You are charged for:
	A. Size of data
	B. Number of requests
	C. Transfer Acceleration
	D. Moving of data within locations.
	E. Storage management Pricing
	
S3 Transfer Acceleration:
1. Used to transfer data between s3 bucket and the users.
2. Uses CloudFront edge locations to route data over optimized network paths.

Note : Read S3 FAQ.

S3 Create Bucket:
1. If you want to switch between new and old console we can go to "Storage management" and opt in for new console.
2. By default when we create a bucket its private by default and so are any objects inside it.
3. bucket name cannot change once bucket is created.

S3 Static Website:
1. S3 website endpoint is like https://<bucketname>.s3-website.<region>@amazonaws.com
2. Permissions are very important if you want to manage access to your s3 website to users.
3. Website usually has 2 pages 1 main page and 1 error page.

CORS S3:
1. Used for accessing an s3 bucket from another bucket.
2. For website url.
3. Permissions --> cors --> paste url of the origin that wants to use this resource.

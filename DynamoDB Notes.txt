Dynamo DB Basics:
1. No SQL non relational db.	
2. Stored on SSDs.
3. Stored at 3 different geographic locations.

Consistency Models:
1. Eventual consistent model(Default): Consistency is achieved within seconds. 
2. Strong consistent read: Always consistent. Write before all reads.

Structure:
1. Items are json objects.
2. Attributes are json attributes.
3. We can have 35 level of nesting.

Pricing:
Pricing is done on transactions and duration of data kept.

Types of Primary keys:
1. Single Attribute Partition index - These are the hashed values of partition values that are unique.
2. If two items have the same partition key then they should have a different sort key.
3. All items with the same partition key will be store together with ordered sort keys.

Indexes:
1. Local secondary index: Same partition key and different sort key.
2. Local secondary indexes cannot be added or removed later, they are created at the time of creating the table.
3. Global secondary indexes can have different partition keys and different sort keys.
